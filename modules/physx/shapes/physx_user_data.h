/**
 * @file physx_user_data.h
 * @brief userData bridge structures between PhysX and Godot.
 *
 * PhysX provides a raw `void* userData` field on PxActor and PxShape. This
 * module uses it to store a back-pointer to the Godot-side wrapper object so
 * that query results and simulation callbacks can recover the Godot RID and
 * ObjectID without maintaining a separate lookup table.
 *
 * Convention: every PxActor/PxShape created by this module MUST have its
 * userData set to the appropriate struct below. Consumers MUST cast to the
 * documented type — never to PhysXObject3D* or PhysXBody3D* directly.
 *
 * Note: PxShape::userData points at the shared PhysXShape3D* blueprint
 * (the same pointer returned by PhysXShape3D::create_shape's caller).
 * The shape_index for each PxShape is tracked in the owning body/area's
 * shapes[] array, not stored in the shape itself.

// and would collide with physx_shape_3d.h's global forward declarations) can

 * @brief Attached to PxActor::userData.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth that bridges a PhysX actor back to
 * Godot-side data during queries (raycast, overlap, sweep) and simulation
 * callbacks (onContact, onTrigger).
 *
 * bounce/friction carry the Godot-side SIGNED values (negative = absorbent /
 * rough) so the contact-modify callback — which runs on a worker thread and
 * must not touch Godot objects — can implement Godot's material combiner. They
 * are written from the main thread before simulate() (in on_pre_step /
 * _apply_params_to_actor) and only read during simulate(), so plain floats are
 * safe under the synchronous step model.
