	// hold joint chains steadier under sustained external forces (wind,
	// thrusters), but can be looser on joints in large mixed rigid-body
	// scenes and has seen far less validation here. Opt in per project if
	// you want to play with it; default remains PGS.

	// physics/physx_3d/simulation/allow_sleep

	//
	// Default OFF in this module: the flag
	// applies an extra damping force to low-kinetic-energy bodies, which on a
	// sphere sliding down a ramp suppresses the angular acceleration from
	// contact friction — the sphere slides instead of rolling. Stacks are

	// post-step hooks run in sync(), which the engine calls at the start of
	// the NEXT tick (main.cpp order: sync -> flush_queries -> scripts ->
	// end_sync -> step). The solve therefore overlaps the rest of the frame.
	// Read live per server step, so it can be toggled at runtime; flipping it
	// mid-flight is safe (step() fetches defensively).
	//
	// Caveats when on:
	//  - A scene query issued while a solve is in flight forces an immediate
	//    fetch (PhysX forbids queries against a running scene).
	//  - Server calls that land in the in-flight window (deferred calls,
	//    node destruction) have their actor add/remove/release queued until
	//    the fetch; the wrappers must route releases through the space.
	//  - Body/actor data writes from scripts still happen after sync() (the
	//    engine order keeps scripts out of the in-flight window).
