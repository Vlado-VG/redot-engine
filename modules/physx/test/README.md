# PhysX 5.11 Backend — Automated Integration & Torture Test Suite

Automated, headless, CI-ready test suite for the custom PhysX 5.11
`PhysicsServer3D` backend (`modules/physx`). This is **not** a visual debugging
laboratory — there is no UI, no interactive controls, no rendered inspection.
Every check is programmatic and every run produces a console report, a
machine-readable JSON report, and a non-zero process exit code on failure.

The chain under test:

```
C# / .NET  ─┐
            ├─> Godot PhysicsServer3D API ─> custom PhysX module ─> RID/resource
GDScript  ─┘                                 management ─> Godot/PhysX conversion
                                              ─> PhysX 5.11 ─> simulation ─> sync
                                              ─> PhysicsServer3D results
```

## Suites (what `--suite` selects; `--suite all` = the blocking default set)

| Suite     | Scripts | Purpose | Runs in the blocking default set |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------------------------|
| `csharp`  | `tests/csharp/TestMain.cs` | Exhaustive behavioral/torture/regression backend testing (canonical) | yes |
| `gdscript`| `gdscript_binding_tests.gd` | Same backend through the GDScript binding layer | yes |
| `smoke`   | `physics_smoke_test.gd` | Node-level drop/settle end-to-end sanity | yes |
| `blast`   | `blast_smoke_test.gd` | Blast authoring + destructible lifecycle (skips itself on `blast=no` builds) | yes |
| `vehicle` | `vehicle_server_check.gd`, `vehicle_node_test.gd`, `vehicle_gearbox_test.gd` | Server-RID + node vehicle stacks, engine drive/gearbox | yes |
| `async`   | `async_stress_test.gd` | Mid-flight mutation churn under `async_step` (fetch-guard coverage) | yes |
| `flow`    | `flow_smoke_test.gd` | NVIDIA Flow end-to-end (needs a Vulkan runtime) | opt-in |
| `gpu`     | `gpu_smoke_test.gd` | CUDA/GPU object family (needs a CUDA runtime) | opt-in |

Every wired suite parses `--json=<path>` and writes a `final: true` report —
the driver treats a missing report as `CRASH` even when the process exits 0.
The `mpm_*`, `async_churn_test.gd`, and `iteration_bench.gd` scripts need a
rendering device (windowed run) or are benchmarks, and stay manual.

A failure in C# but not GDScript (or vice versa) isolates a marshaling/binding
regression from an underlying physics regression. All suites write their own
JSON report; `run_suite.py` merges them and tags each with its suite origin.

## Running

All commands assume the repo root as CWD. `GODOT` is a C#-enabled build of this
engine (`module_mono_enabled=yes` for the C# suite). The GDScript suite runs on
any build with the PhysX module.

```bash
# Everything (fast tier): csharp + gdscript + smoke + blast + vehicle, with
# crash detection and merged JSON:
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot bin/redot.windows.editor.x86_64.console.exe

# Individual suites (repeatable --suite):
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite blast --suite vehicle

# GPU tier (opt-in; needs a CUDA/Vulkan runtime on this machine):
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite flow --suite gpu

# Extended tier (fast + extended tests):
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --tier extended

# Nightly tier (adds soak + heavy stress, one process per category):
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --tier nightly

# Single category / single test / custom seed:
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp --category joints
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp --test PHYSX-CCD-001
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp --seed 987654321

# Deterministic randomized stress (reproducible; prints seed + op index on failure):
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp --test PHYSX-STRS-002 --seed 123456

# Regression suite only:
python modules/physx/test/run_suite.py --godot <exe> --suite csharp --category regressions
```

Direct engine invocation (what the driver does under the hood):

```bash
# C# (requires `dotnet build modules/physx/test/project/physx_ci.csproj` first):
<godot> --headless --fixed-fps 60 --path modules/physx/test/project \
    --script res://tests/csharp/TestMain.cs -- --tier=fast --json=out.json

# GDScript (works on non-C# builds too):
<godot> --headless --fixed-fps 60 --path modules/physx/test/project \
    --script res://gdscript/gdscript_binding_tests.gd -- --json=out.json
```

User arguments (after `--`): `--tier=fast|extended|nightly`,
`--category=<name>` (repeatable), `--test=<ID>` (repeatable), `--seed=<int>`,
`--json=<path>`, `--list`, `--max-seconds=<wall clock cap>`.

## Recommended CI tiers

| Tier     | Trigger      | Contents                                                     | Budget |
|----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `fast`   | every commit | default suites (csharp, gdscript, smoke, blast, vehicle, async) + a non-blocking GPU step (flow, gpu) | ~10 min |
| `extended` | pre-merge  | fast + extended-tagged tests (bigger stacks, longer runs)    | ~30 min |
| `nightly`| scheduled    | extended + soak (10,000+ frames) + randomized op storm, run per-category for crash isolation | hours |

`run_suite.py --tier nightly` launches each category as a **separate process**
so a native crash takes out only its category and is reported as `CRASH`,
never as a pass. A missing JSON `final: true` marker or a non-zero/negative
engine exit code is treated as `CRASH`/`TIMEOUT` respectively. The CI job
(`gitlab-ci-physx.yml`) runs the GPU suites (flow, gpu) as a trailing step
whose test failures are reported but do not fail the pipeline — a driver-level
error (exit 2) still does.

## Result model

Per test: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `SKIP` / `TIMEOUT` / `CRASH`. Console summary:

```
====================================================
  Godot PhysX 5.11 Integration Test Suite (C#)
====================================================
  Backend: PhysX    Physics FPS: 60    Seed: 123456

```

JSON report (one entry per test): `id`, `category`, `status`, `duration_ms`,
`assertions`, `failures[]`, `seed` (when relevant), `diagnostics`, plus a
document-level `final` flag that is only `true` after the runner finished
cleanly (crash forensics for CI).

## Test philosophy

* **Behavior over storage.** Whenever a parameter is supposed to affect
  simulation, the test builds a physical experiment (drop, slide, spin,
  collide, constrain) and measures the outcome. Setter/getter round-trips are
  used only as API plumbing checks and are labeled as such.
* **Tolerances are justified** per assertion (solver softness, sleeping
  thresholds, 60 Hz quantization). No exact float equality on physical
  quantities; no tolerance wide enough to hide a broken behavior.
* **Determinism**: fixed timestep via `--fixed-fps 60`, explicit seeds for all
  randomized tests; failing randomized tests print `seed` and operation index.
* **Isolation**: every test runs in its own freshly created space, frees all
  resources in `finally`, and a shared "canary" pattern verifies that
  destroying one resource never corrupts unrelated live ones.
* **No fake tests**: functionality that is not implemented (soft-body
  simulation is currently an API skeleton in the module) is reported as
  `SKIP` with a reason, not silently passed.

## Coverage map of the original `physx_test_suite.gd` (predecessor)

The original single-file GDScript suite (~60 checks) was catalogued before
this suite was built:

* **Already strong (behavioral)** — ported and kept: backend selection, free
  fall + velocity gain, impulse Δv = J/m, constant force/torque integration,
  area gravity override effect, area monitoring (match/no-match/area-area),
  kinematic teleport, linear-Y axis lock, sleep/can-sleep/wake-on-impulse,
  ray/point/shape/rest-info queries, body_test_motion (hit/free/depenetration),
  layer filtering + collision exceptions via sweeps, contact reporting with
  up-normal, vehicle drive + 4-wheel telemetry, mode-switch fall, mid-sim
  frees (shared shape, jointed body, chassis, whole space).
* **API round-trip only** — kept as plumbing checks and paired with new
  behavioral counterparts: all shape data getters, body params (mass, bounce,
  friction, gravity scale, CCD flag, COM, inertia), all joint params/flags,
  area params, solver iterations, shape margin.
* **False-positive risks found** — `check(true, ...)` placeholder for
  exception add/remove (always passed); soft-body stubs counted as PASS; CCD
  verified as flag storage only, never as tunneling prevention.
* **Missing entirely** — added by this suite: pairwise shape collision
  matrix, rotated/transformed shape collision, shape mutation while shared,
  restitution & friction measurements, damping curves, mass-ratio response,
  gravity scale measurement, all axis-lock combinations, off-center force →
  angular response, joint constraint/limit/motor behavior + chains + loops,
  CCD tunneling regression, space isolation, stale-RID and invalid-input
  handling, numerical robustness (NaN/INF/large/small), deterministic replay,
  soak, seeded randomized stress, regression category, machine-readable
  output, per-test IDs/timeouts/crash isolation.

The old files (`physx_test_suite.gd`, `physx_quick_test.gd`,
`physx_vehicle_test.gd`, `PhysXVehicleEcsTest.cs`) were removed after their
coverage was absorbed into the two new suites.

## Test results & artifacts

All JSON reports and logs land in `modules/physx/test/test_results/`
(regardless of the directory the driver is invoked from) and that directory is
`.gitignore`d — reports are CI artifacts, never committed. `make_tarball.sh`
in `misc/scripts/` is the upstream release-packaging script, unrelated to
testing.

## Known module limitations encoded by tests

* `body_set_collision_priority` — documented no-op in the module (getter
  always returns 1.0); tested as such.
* Pin joint `BIAS/DAMPING/IMPULSE_CLAMP`, joint solver priority — stored,
  round-tripped, not simulated; tested as storage only.
* Slider angular limits — stored only; linear limits enforced.
* `cast_motion` / `body_test_motion` follow godot_physics per-object overlap disregard: objects the query starts inside of are skipped (a forward blocker behind them still bounds the motion); an overlap deeper than the recovery slack is "stuck" (safe = unsafe = 0).
* Soft-body — API skeleton, no `PxDeformableVolume`; behavioral tests SKIP.
* Wind area params — stored, not applied.
